# Features

As there is very little information about this airstrip and was more of a request, I've tried to add buildings and objects that looks like it would fit in within this type of airstrip. Also tried to match it the best I could using top down Google Maps imagery. 

* Runway added with no number markings (They are no markings in the real world on this strip)
* GA Parking Spot
* Multiple static aircraft
* Multiple static objects such as buildings, cars, fences and more.
